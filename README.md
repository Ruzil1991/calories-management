This is a CRUD web application for tracking food intake. You can see meal records red or green color based on the daily calories limit: If sum of daily food intake exceeds the set limit then meal records are red otherwise they're green. By default the limit is 2000 but you can set your own and see different output. Also you can filter the records by date and time. The application is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and available via the link below http://sharifullinruzil-env-1.eba-rgkkh83y.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/
